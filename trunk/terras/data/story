The demo story (although I'm certainly open to suggestions on this) is that the player begins on a beach of an island in the midst of a large ocean.  This could be from a shipwreck or some other disaster, which may or may not be shown in an animation.  A shipwreck or crashed plane is nearby.

The island is rather steep, and perhaps a hundred feet at its highest, despite being at most a quarter mile across the longer end.  A radio antenna is at the top.
