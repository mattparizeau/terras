= Required Features =
 * Solid OpenGL cube rendering that should not show gaps in the cube under any circumstances. _Partial_
 * YAML support for configuration files and node definitions. _Partial_
 * Traversal of the graph from within the game.
 * Scripting or other interactivity support to actually create puzzles
 * Sound and music support through SDL_mixer.

= Secondary Features =
 * A small but legitimate test game.  Rendering should probably be done in either [http://www.povray.org/ POV-Ray] or [http://www.blender.org Blender].
 * Animation support (full-screen or only part of the frame).
 * Advanced audio support (3D stereo, 5.1 support?).

= Longer-term Feature Proposals =
 * HDR support with the ability to vary exposure with some sensitivity to light.  Perhaps the effect could even be applied slowly, similar to how we react to a dark room or bright light.
 * GLSL depth support, rendering either realtime fog or adding focal blur depending on the depth under the cursor.  Other features to add depth to prerendered scenes should be considered.
